            QuickAsk is a new startup that has every intention of making your
            life easier. The idea came about after Founder, Leo Gonzalez found
            himself awake at all hours in order to appease our new Global Market
            and Tech Lifestyle

            As the world becomes united and technology allows for constant and
            instant communication, a new challenge of timing has arrived-while
            the west coast is sleeping, the east coast rises and Europe is well
            within their day. When on Earth can we all get together to meet.

            Due to this global collaboration, Leo found himself tired of working
            all hours of the day and night and decided to create QuickAsk.
