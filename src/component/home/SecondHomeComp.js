                         There is no replacement for a face-to-face interview, that’s why phone interviews are so ineffective. But when you can’t meet face-to-face,
                        the best thing you can do is to have a video-recorded interview,
                        and that’s what we do. We give you the best interview tool so you can make the right decision on the most qualified candidate for your job.

                        carry on with the interview knowing full well the candidate does not have a chance. Most of us are polite and continue with
                         it until the end. However, our politeness just cost us one hour; and we have five more candidates to interview.<br></br><br></br>
